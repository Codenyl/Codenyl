Codenyl is an umbrella brand under which independently designed and independently purposed projects and products are released. It is not a single platform, or product, but a collection of work created and directed by Aaradhy Mishra.

Each product under Codenyl exists on its own terms. Products do not need to share architecture, accounts, technology, audience, or tone. Codenyl does not impose uniformity; it provides origin, identity, and accountability. The brand is always present but secondary—products come first.

Nothing enters Codenyl automatically. Inclusion is a deliberate choice, and removal or retirement is also possible when a product no longer fits, no longer works, or no longer needs to exist.
